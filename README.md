# AutomatedShutdownSystem
   This code will shutdown your system automatically based on user idle time. User's idle time is got through LATINPUTINFO() and is constantly displayed on the screen. If the user perfoms some action, say, a mouse move or a mouse click, the idle time becomes 0 and will start again. When it reaches the stipulated time ,say 600 seconds (10 minutes), your system will shutdown automatically.
